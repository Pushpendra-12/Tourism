            Golghar was meant to be the first in a series of similar structures intended to act as a preventive measure against frequent famines in the area.  None of the other ‘golghars’ were ultimately built, giving us a one-of-a-kind building that you must-visit in Patna.<br>
            One of the largest temples dedicated to Lord Hanuman, Patna’s Mahavir Temple is a tranquil oasis in a crowded urban jungle. Most likely built in the 17th century, the temple started gaining popularity after India’s partition in 1947 when a large number of Hindu refugees from the newly-created Pakistan started settling down in the city. Besides the beautiful idol of Lord Hanuman, the temple is also home to a ‘floating stone’ from the legendary Ram Setu.<br>
            Patna is revered by the followers of the Sikh religion as this is the place where the 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singhji was born. Takht Sri Patna Sahib was built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh to commemorate the event. Also known as Harmandir Sahib, the holy shrine is built in the old quarters of Patna city in an area known as Kucha Farrukh Khan and is thronged with devotees from all over the globe. Visit it for a glimpse into Sikh history. Relics of the 10th Guru like four iron arrows, weapons, a pair of his sandals and a cradle with gold-plated stands are housed in the shrine.

            Chhath is an ancient Hindu Vedic festival historically native to the Indian subcontinent, more specifically, the Indian states of Bihar.The Chhath Puja is dedicated to the Solar deity (Surya) in order to thank him for bestowing the bounties of life on earth and to request the granting of certain wishes.This festival is observed by Biharis & Nepalese along with their diaspora.
            The festival does not involve idolatry and is dedicated to worship Lord Surya (the Sun deity). ' Chhathi Maiya ' is the mother goddess who provides strength and support to the poor. She is worshipped as ' goddess of the festival '.The Sun is offered arghya(offering/homage) in the evening of the first day and in the morning of the second day.And the rituals are rigorous and are observed over a period of four days.They include holy bathing, fasting and abstaining from drinking water (Vratta), standing in water for long periods of time, and offering prasad (prayer offerings) and arghya to the setting and rising sun.Some devotees also perform a prostration march as they head for the river banks

            The lip-smacking taste of Litti Chokha, savoured by one and all, needs no introduction. It is your grand welcome to the food of Bihar, in all its ghee-dripping glory. It consists of wheat and sattu with spices, kneaded into round spicy balls, dipped in ghee. The texture of Litti along with the crunchy crust makes it a foodie’s delight. Chokha is prepared by mashing boiled vegetables (most common being potatoes, brinjal, tomatoes), adding spices and chopped onion, garlic etc and served with Litti as a complimentary delicacy.

Sattu or fried gram flour forms a distinctive element of Bihari food and cuisine. The sattu is mixed with spices and filled in wheat dough balls, rolled and cooked with ghee on a hot plate to form sattu paratha which is also called makuni.
